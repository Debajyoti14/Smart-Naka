The problem we are solving is Assam Police‚Äôs - Smart Naka

Currently police have to manually check cars at Naka to determine the car is stolen or not.

We also added a Missing Car Diary Feature where people can add their missing Car Details.

Also We can get details of any vehicle with its vehicle No. which will help the on-field police officer.
