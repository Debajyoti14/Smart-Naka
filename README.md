## What is Smart Naka? ü§î
It is an application to facilitate police officers with Nakas in a more convenient way.

## What Problem it solves? üòä
The problem we are solving is Assam Police‚Äôs - Smart Naka

Currently police have to manually check cars at Naka to determine the car is stolen or not.

We trained a model with OpenCV & YoloV5 to make a accurate Number Plate Detection Model. It will send push notifications to nearby police station Police mobile apps to notify them.

We also added a Missing Car Diary Feature where people can add their missing Car Details.

Also We can get details of any vehicle with its vehicle No. which will help the on-field police officer.

There is also a filter Stolen Car details Feature. By selecting police station and number of days, You will get all the stolen car history occurred in the timespan.

This is the problem we are solving with this application.
