## What Problem it solves? üòä
The problem we are solving is Assam Police‚Äôs - Smart Naka

Currently police have to manually check cars at Naka to determine the car is stolen or not.

We also added a Missing Car Diary Feature where people can add their missing Car Details.

Also We can get details of any vehicle with its vehicle No. which will help the on-field police officer.

There is also a filter Stolen Car details Feature. By selecting police station and number of days, You will get all the stolen car history occurred in the timespan.

This is the problem we are solving and we are really confident about it.
